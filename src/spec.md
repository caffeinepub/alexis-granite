## Summary
**Goal:** Update all public-facing branding to consistently reflect the company name “Alexis Granite” across the homepage and global layout while keeping the “Free Estimates” and “Travel Anywhere” messaging prominent.

**Planned changes:**
- Replace header brand text with “Alexis Granite”.
- Replace footer brand text with “Alexis Granite”.
- Update the homepage hero branding/headline area to clearly identify the company as “Alexis Granite” while preserving prominent “Free Estimates” and “Travel Anywhere” callouts.
- Update the HTML document `<title>` (browser tab title) to reflect “Alexis Granite”.

**User-visible outcome:** Visitors see consistent “Alexis Granite” branding across the site (header, footer, hero, and browser tab), with “Free Estimates” and “Travel Anywhere” still prominently displayed.
